**internal changes and refactorings to do**

- change now interaction with Burden in the creation pipeline happen. Especially try to eliminate the ugly context.AttachExistingBurden(burden); call

- add "default components" as replacement for removing components. Those would be used by Windsor as a fallback, but if something else is registered (no matter before or after) the other thing would be used.

- better unify exceptions thrown and start taking advantage of what the exception facilities in Visual Studio and .NET provide.
